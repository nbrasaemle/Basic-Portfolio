        <p>
            My name is Nicole Brasaemle, and I have a Bachelor of Science in Geology and a Mathematics Minor.
            I am currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota's Full-Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp.
            In this boot camp I am learning to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. 
            I currently work in retail.
            I hope to work with computers, programming, or web development when finished with this boot camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding, I like to spend time with my family and our dogs, go hiking at local and state parks, and read.
