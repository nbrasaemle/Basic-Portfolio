                My name is Nicole Brasaemle, and I have a Bachelor of Science in Geology and a Mathematics Minor.
                I am currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota's Full-Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp.
                In this boot camp I am learning to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. 
                I have experience in sales and managing. I currently work in retail.
                I hope to work with computers, programming, or web development when finished with this boot camp.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I am not coding, I like to spend time with my family and our dogs, go hiking at local and state parks, and read.
                I also enjoy watching movies, tv, and playing video games for the PC, Wii, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS. 
                My absolute favorite game is "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" made by Bethsaida.
